              <p>So for todays blog I will be announcing that I have started on the avatar selection process. As well as fixed up a couple of bugs that were occuring.
              For instance when when players grabbed an item in the virtual world, only the local world was changing rather than the multiplayer world. So it will still look the same
              as if the other player did not interact with the environment. I will be showing a video of it tomorrow explaining more in depth about what I mean about this. So please
              stay tune for that video</p>
