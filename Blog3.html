               <p>After talking to Dr,Diefenbach about the problems that I was facing regarding this project. I have decided to cut back on some of the content.
            How I originally planned this out was using the VRchat playform to create three trypes of worlds, one was going to be a park like setting, the other one
            was going to be set ip in a party like experience, but in the end I have decided to cut down two out of three worlds since the workload was going to be intense if still
            kept.</p>
            <p>My new approach in how I will tackle this project will be as followes. I will be comparing and contrasting vrchat vs my own personal project to see which one will be best for what
            I am trying to accomplish</p>
            <p>For this week I have revised my plan from what I thought I was going to do. To what I will be now doing.</p>
            <p>This week I have successfully connected the project to the internet. By internet I mean that I was able to connect it to a network using Photon.
            The Photon engine is a game engine specializing in multiplayer game development. Itâ€™s a series of products, software, technology, and networking components that bring great speed, performance, 
              and more to online play.</p>
