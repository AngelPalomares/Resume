               <p>After talking to Dr,Diefenbach about the problems that I was facing regarding this project. I have decided to cut back on some of the content.
            How I originally planned this out was using the VRchat playform to create three trypes of worlds, one was going to be a park like setting, the other one
            was going to be set ip in a party like experience, but in the end I have decided to cut down two out of three worlds since the workload was going to be intense if still
            kept.</p>
            <p>My new approach in how I will tackle this project will be as followes. I will be comparing and contrasting vrchat vs my own personal project to see which one will be best for what
            I am trying to accomplish</p>
            <p>For this week I have revised my plan from what I thought I was going to do. To what I will be now doing.</p>
            <p>This week I have successfully connected the project to the internet. By internet I mean that I was able to connect it to a network using Photon.
            The Photon engine is a game engine specializing in multiplayer game development. Itâ€™s a series of products, software, technology, and networking components that bring great speed, performance, 
              and more to online play.</p>

           <p>After reading the documentation and succesfully implementting the require test these are the rest that happened during gameplay</p>
           <p>Week 5</p>
           <p>Continuation on the VRchat like clone. If completed then I will do a comparison as to what is better and what was easier to implement.</p>
           <p>Week 6</p>
           <p>Continuation of the VRchat like clone but this time allow the player to select where they want to go. For example giving them the ability to select worlds
           and be able to connect with them</p>
           <p>Week 7</p>
           <p>Implementation of spawning into the game as well as trying to list how many players are currently connected between the different worlds</p>
           <p>Week 8</p>
           <p>Implemenation of avatar selection. Allowing the player to choose between different already created character.</p>
           <p>Week 9</p>
           <p>Implementation of voice chat as well as wrapping things up</p>
           <p>Week 10</p>

   <p>In todays daily blog I will be talking to you about the progress that I have made with the Vrchat clone. For starters I have succesfully implemented a keyboard into the game.
       Why a keyboard you ask? Because I want people to be able to log in with whatever name they feel comfortable with, I have also added tha ability to log in annonymosly if they do
       not want to name themselse.</p>
       <p>The code that you see here is the code that I have used for when it comes to connecting to the online multiplayer. When starting the game you will have the ability to choose between
       Logging in with a name or without a name. If the player chooses to log in with a name an if system was implemented so that they dont just leave it blank. Once the player finishes
       choosing the way they want to log in, a function will be sent to photon to see if they are able to connect. Once connected it will load into their home scene where they will be able to pick
       from a selection of avatars to worlds that were created. Those functions will be added later into the game.</p>

       <p>So a little bit about the script that was posted above this paragraph. It allows the player to create their very own room, using the Photon framework. The only
       downside for the free version is that you are limited to only about 20 players compared to other platforms that allow up to 100 players at once. Once succesfully
       connected to the photon network it will create a room, if not then it will continue to work until connection is made</p>
       <p>So in summary the first script is used for when the player is trying to log in to the service while the other script is used for when they want to join other worlds,
       the ability to pick and join a world will be developed at a later time but will be possible towards the end of the class. A summary of everything will be provided tomorow</p>

           <h3>4/27/2022 <h3/>
          <div class ="boxstyle">
              <p>So for todays blog I will be talking about the updates that I have made for the game. Currently with the build that I have made so far, it has allowed me to create worlds
              where players are able to join in. In the home menu of the game you can see the amount of players that are in that specific room. So lets say before you enter you will see that
              it says 0/20 but once someone enters that specific lobby it will change that counter to 1 telling to you that someone is inside that room.</p>
              <p>I have stumbled into some difficulties today, for starters the worlds were not connecting to the proper worlds and they werent updating as they should. The number for
              how mnay players were currently in the world was stuck at zero. After 2 hours of debugging the mistake that was causing that error was that a function was not being called properly. The function
              that was preventing things to work properly is called OnConnectedToMaster. This function in particular grabs the name of the player that is placed by them in the login scene, after that it grabs their name
              and moves them into the main hub. But I made the mistake on placing the PhotonNetwork.LoadLevel("HomeScene"); on onconnected instead of onconnectedtomaster since this function
              calls the main server and if connected successfully transports them to the main hub.</p>
           </div>
          <h3>4/28/2022 <h3/>
          <div class ="boxstyle">
              <p>So for todays blog I will be trying to clarify a few things about the project that I am currently working on and why am I creating it.</p>
              
              <p>What is the purpose?</p>
              <p>The purpose of this project that I am doing is to get a better understanding in creating a VR chat like clone. The reason as to wht i chose to do this was
              because if I were to create something along the lines in the future. I would have a better understanding in creating one. Since this would be the first time
              that I will be working in getting a game to use online multiplayer</p>
              <p>What it will look it?</p>
              <p>When it comes to the worlds I was in the mindet of creating two worlds so that player can travel, explore and talk to one another. Why do something like this
              when discord does the same thing? I want to create a social virtual reality game where players are able to hang out, as well as to help them when it comes to social anxiety.
              Since talking to someone behind the screen is not the same way as to talking to them and seeing their reactions through a virtual reality headset.</p>
              <p>Technology Problems?</p>
              <p>One of the main problems that I will be facing would be getting the multiplayer up and running. I can get it up and running but I also have to make it
              where other players are able to see each other, be able to speak to one anotherm and be able to join different worlds together. As you saw from the past post
              I was having difficulties when it comes to just updating a counter where it shows how many players are in a room.</p>
              <p>Requirements</p>
              <p>So for the requirements that I am trying to aim is to get it up and running for PC. As well as get it up and running for Meta Quest 2.</p>
              <p>Users role</p>
              <p>The user will be able to talk to one another as well as be able to interact with the world that they are in. Main purpose is so that people are able to interact
                  with other people but in the virtual world</p>
              <p>I know it was late but I wanted to sit down and decided what I will be doing. For tomorrows blog I will be showing what I have worked on and the next steps
              that I will be doing when it comes to this project. As well as a revision of the goals that I have in mind.</p>

          <div class ="boxstyle">
              <p>So for todays blog I have implemented to where the player is allowed to pick a world and their avatars stays with them. At the moment it only works with local testing,
              since more than one character on the screen cause the game to crash. I will look into this in the coming days. But so far it has been a success. The way that you do this process is that you
              call the photon networn and you instantiate a character prefab, if succesful it will connect to the network and at the spawn of the world you will be able move around with the premade character.</p>
