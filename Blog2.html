               <p>After talking to Dr,Diefenbach about the problems that I was facing regarding this project. I have decided to cut back on some of the content.
            How I originally planned this out was using the VRchat playform to create three trypes of worlds, one was going to be a park like setting, the other one
            was going to be set ip in a party like experience, but in the end I have decided to cut down two out of three worlds since the workload was going to be intense if still
            kept.</p>
            <p>My new approach in how I will tackle this project will be as followes. I will be comparing and contrasting vrchat vs my own personal project to see which one will be best for what
            I am trying to accomplish</p>
            <p>For this week I have revised my plan from what I thought I was going to do. To what I will be now doing.</p>
            <p>This week I have successfully connected the project to the internet. By internet I mean that I was able to connect it to a network using Photon.
            The Photon engine is a game engine specializing in multiplayer game development. Itâ€™s a series of products, software, technology, and networking components that bring great speed, performance, 
              and more to online play.</p>

         height = "500" />
            
         <img src="Photon.jpg" alt="Successful Connection"
         width = "400"
         height = "500" />
           
           <p>After reading the documentation and succesfully implementting the require test these are the rest that happened during gameplay</p>
           <p>Week 5</p>
           <p>Continuation on the VRchat like clone. If completed then I will do a comparison as to what is better and what was easier to implement.</p>
           <p>Week 6</p>
           <p>Continuation of the VRchat like clone but this time allow the player to select where they want to go. For example giving them the ability to select worlds
           and be able to connect with them</p>
           <p>Week 7</p>
           <p>Implementation of spawning into the game as well as trying to list how many players are currently connected between the different worlds</p>
           <p>Week 8</p>
           <p>Implemenation of avatar selection. Allowing the player to choose between different already created character.</p>
           <p>Week 9</p>
           <p>Implementation of voice chat as well as wrapping things up</p>
           <p>Week 10</p>
           <p>Present the project that I have been working on</p>
