               <p>After talking to Dr,Diefenbach about the problems that I was facing regarding this project. I have decided to cut back on some of the content.
            How I originally planned this out was using the VRchat playform to create three trypes of worlds, one was going to be a park like setting, the other one
            was going to be set ip in a party like experience, but in the end I have decided to cut down two out of three worlds since the workload was going to be intense if still
            kept.</p>
            <p>My new approach in how I will tackle this project will be as followes. I will be comparing and contrasting vrchat vs my own personal project to see which one will be best for what
            I am trying to accomplish</p>
            <p>For this week I have revised my plan from what I thought I was going to do. To what I will be now doing.</p>
            <p>This week I have successfully connected the project to the internet. By internet I mean that I was able to connect it to a network using Photon.
            The Photon engine is a game engine specializing in multiplayer game development. Itâ€™s a series of products, software, technology, and networking components that bring great speed, performance, 
              and more to online play.</p>

           <p>After reading the documentation and succesfully implementting the require test these are the rest that happened during gameplay</p>
           <p>Week 5</p>
           <p>Continuation on the VRchat like clone. If completed then I will do a comparison as to what is better and what was easier to implement.</p>
           <p>Week 6</p>
           <p>Continuation of the VRchat like clone but this time allow the player to select where they want to go. For example giving them the ability to select worlds
           and be able to connect with them</p>
           <p>Week 7</p>
           <p>Implementation of spawning into the game as well as trying to list how many players are currently connected between the different worlds</p>
           <p>Week 8</p>
           <p>Implemenation of avatar selection. Allowing the player to choose between different already created character.</p>
           <p>Week 9</p>
           <p>Implementation of voice chat as well as wrapping things up</p>
           <p>Week 10</p>
           <p>Present the project that I have been working on</p>

   <p>In todays daily blog I will be talking to you about the progress that I have made with the Vrchat clone. For starters I have succesfully implemented a keyboard into the game.
       Why a keyboard you ask? Because I want people to be able to log in with whatever name they feel comfortable with, I have also added tha ability to log in annonymosly if they do
       not want to name themselse.</p>
       <p>The code that you see here is the code that I have used for when it comes to connecting to the online multiplayer. When starting the game you will have the ability to choose between
       Logging in with a name or without a name. If the player chooses to log in with a name an if system was implemented so that they dont just leave it blank. Once the player finishes
       choosing the way they want to log in, a function will be sent to photon to see if they are able to connect. Once connected it will load into their home scene where they will be able to pick
       from a selection of avatars to worlds that were created. Those functions will be added later into the game.</p>

       <p>So a little bit about the script that was posted above this paragraph. It allows the player to create their very own room, using the Photon framework. The only
       downside for the free version is that you are limited to only about 20 players compared to other platforms that allow up to 100 players at once. Once succesfully
       connected to the photon network it will create a room, if not then it will continue to work until connection is made</p>
