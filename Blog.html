                      <p>So a little bit about the thesis topic. When it comes to the topic I would like to explore the positive side about social virtual
                      reality MMORPGs the one that require the user to use a headset. With the rise and popularity of virtual reality headset, more and more people
                      have gone to these social VR games to interact with random people online. I believe that these kind of games can be used to help people with
                      their social anxiety. Allowing them to interact with people from the comfort of their own home, and with the experience that have developed
                      when talking to random people. It would allow the user to become more comfortable in talking to people in the real world.</p></div>

                      <p>Today on this day I have been exploring literature reviews when it comes to my topic. I have stumbled upon some good reviews and i plan
                  on reading them to get some more insight on how I should approach it</p></div>

                      <p>Researched the provided information that was given on my discussion board. As well as attended the meeting with Dr.Diefenbach about the
                  further steps that I will need in order to narrow down what I want my thesis to be about</p></div>
                   
              <h3>04/05/2022<h3/>
              <div class ="boxstyle">
                      <p>For this day I investigated different kinds of virtual reality games that also allow the user to use a virtual reality headset.
                  The reason why I have decided to go this route is because with a head mounted display, it will allow the user to feel as if they are inside that evironment.
                  Compared to a traditional way where it will just be using a computer screen. When it comes to this thesis, I would like it that when it comes to the knowledge
                  that they have acquired in the experiment, could be put to use in the real world. That with them getting practice with interacting with people in the virtual space, they would
                  do the same in real life.
                  </p>
                  <p>I will be talking about the different platforms as the days go by since I will be gathering information about the platforms, and if they
                  will be useful with the kind of experiment that I will be conducting. So for the first platform that I was looking into would be a game called <a href="https://hello.vrchat.com/">Vrchat</a>.
                  Vrchat is an online virtual world platfrom. With Vrchat it allows the user to explore vast variety of worlds as well as the ability to try out different avatars. With the ability
                  of being able to try out an endless amount of avatars it enables the experience of allowing the user to be who they want to be.
                  </p>
                  <p>Vrchat allows users to be able to come up with their very own worlds. If I were to go with this platform I will be able to create a world where I will have
                  the ability for control, since without much control then the experiment will be a major flop.</p>

                  <p> For todays blog I will be talking about <a href=https://www.oasis.world/#/new> Oasis. Oasis is a Social VR game where you can make friends
                      from aroun the world. You are able to chat with them, and play games with them. You can also create your very own avatars. The big difference about
                      Oasis is that oasis can be played from your phone. After downloading Oasis onto my computer I was greeted with an error message. After countless hours
                      of trying to fix it, I have decided to not go with this platform since I was not able to properly launch it. I was looking forward to using oasis since from thel ooks of it their world
                      creation looks intereting to work with. From looking at their website they are reworking the Pc version of oasis. I have also set up an interview
                      with a therapist to get more information about social anxiety.</p>
