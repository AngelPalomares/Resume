                      <p>So a little bit about the thesis topic. When it comes to the topic I would like to explore the positive side about social virtual
                      reality MMORPGs the one that require the user to use a headset. With the rise and popularity of virtual reality headset, more and more people
                      have gone to these social VR games to interact with random people online. I believe that these kind of games can be used to help people with
                      their social anxiety. Allowing them to interact with people from the comfort of their own home, and with the experience that have developed
                      when talking to random people. It would allow the user to become more comfortable in talking to people in the real world.</p>
