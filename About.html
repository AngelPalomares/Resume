          <p>About Me<p/>
          <p>Greetings, I'm Angel Martin Palomares. I earned my Masters of Science in Digital Media from Drexel University and completed my Bachelors of Science in Digital Gaming & Simulation at the University of Houston Victoria.<p/>
          <p>Since childhood, my passion for game creation has been evident. I began by crafting conceptual Game Design Documents for the Pikmin series, outlining prospective enemies, mechanics, and playable characters. Once I got to university, I decided to pursue my dreams of being a software engineer to bring to life the games I love playing.</p>
