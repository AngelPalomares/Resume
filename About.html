            <p>Hello, I'm Angel Martin Palomares, a dedicated individual with a background in Digital Media and Digital Gaming & Simulation. Born in Mexico and raised in Houston, Texas, I've shaped my academic journey with a Masters of Science from Drexel University and a Bachelors of Science from the University of Houston Victoria.</p>
            <p>My lifelong passion for game creation became evident early on. Starting with crafting Game Design Documents for the Pikmin series during my childhood, I envisioned enemies, mechanics, and playable characters. Upon entering university, I resolved to pursue a career as a software engineer, driven by the desire to bring to life the games that have always captivated me.</p>
            <p>With a background enriched by academic achievements and diverse experiences, I've had the privilege of working as a software engineer with several companies. I'm motivated to continue growing, learning, and contributing to the dynamic world of technology and game development.</p>
