            <p>In the world of digital creation, where code meets creativity, I've found my calling. I'm Angel, a game developer and software engineer with a penchant for turning complex problems into engaging, interactive experiences. Born from a passion for gaming and a curiosity for programming, my journey has been one of constant learning, innovation, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in digital media.</p>
            <h2>My Adventure in Tech</h2>
            <p>From the bustling city of Houston to the historic streets of Philadelphia, my career has been a journey through the heart of game development and software engineering. As the Lead Software Engineer at Gamucatex, I've been at the forefront of developing cutting-edge gaming features, including pioneering a C#-based save system that redefined our approach to player interaction in WebGL environments.</p>
            <p>At Code Wiz and Drexel University, I shared my knowledge and passion for game development with eager minds, teaching the next generation of developers the principles of programming, UI/UX design, and animation in Unity. These experiences not only deepened my understanding of game development but also underscored the importance of mentorship in the tech industry.</p>
            <h2>The Tech Toolkit</h2>
            <p>My toolbox is filled with languages and frameworks that have become my allies in bringing visions to life:</p>
            <p>•Programming Languages: C++, C#, Python, JavaScript</p>
            <p>•Game Development Tools: Unity Engine, Godot Engine, Unreal Engine</p>
            <p>But beyond the code, it's the skills of leadership, problem-solving, and the ability to coach and develop teams that truly define my professional persona.</p>
            <h2>A Journey of Continuous Learning</h2>
            <p>The pursuit of knowledge took me to the University of Houston Victoria, where I laid the foundation of my career with a Bachelor of Science in Digital Gaming and Simulation, and later to Drexel University, where I earned my Master of Science in Digital Media. These academic milestones were not just about earning degrees; they were about crafting a vision for the kind of developer I wanted to become.</p>
            <h2>Why Connect with Me?</h2>
            <p>My journey is far from over. The ever-evolving landscape of digital media and game development presents new challenges and opportunities every day. If you're passionate about game development, interested in collaborating on projects, or simply want to exchange ideas, I'd love to connect. Let's explore the infinite possibilities of the digital realm together.</p>
            <p>Welcome to my site, and I look forward to sharing more of my journey with you.</p>
