    <p><h2>Space Skirmish</h2></p>
    <em>Unity</em>
    <p>I chose to develop a top-down space shooter game, inspired by Star Fox, for a take-home test. The objective of the game is to endure as long as possible within a set time frame. Successfully outlasting this duration means winning the game.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lead Programmer</li>
        <li>Developed the game's artificial intelligence (AI). When an enemy approaches, the AI automatically locks onto the target. It persistently pursues the enemy until it is eliminated within the game. Additionally, the AI is designed to provide players with opportunities to defeat the enemy AI.</li>
        <li>Integrated a multiplayer feature into the game, enabling players to create and find lobbies, thereby facilitating gameplay with others globally.</li>
        <li>Developed a tutorial to instruct players on the basic principles and mechanics of the game.</li>

    <p><h2>Tectonicus: On the Edge of War</h2></p>
    <em>Unity</em>
    <p>Gamucatex is working on a historical card-based autobattler game. The objective is to immerse players in a captivating exploration of history, fostering reflection on the past and personal experiences. Taking inspiration from a mix of Heroes, Age of Empires, Civilizations, Hearthstone, and Faeria, Gamucatex has chosen Unity as the development platform for this exciting project.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lead Programmer</li>
        <li>Developed a WebGL-based save system mechanism that permits users to save, rename, and delete their decks with ease./li>
        <li>Incorporated multiplayer features into the game, including the ability to create lobbies, discover existing ones, and establish private lobbies for online player interactions.</li>
        <li>Introduced a profanity filter to prevent players from using inappropriate language when creating their lobbies.</li>

    <p><h2>Remember</h2></p>
    <em>Unity 3D</em>
    <p>This game was inspired by games such as "Life Is Strange", "Everybody Has Gone To The Rapture" and "The Stanley Parable". We wanted to create a story base,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lead Programer</li>
        <li>Developed a dynamic dialogue system empowering users to craft engaging in-game conversations. Enriched the experience by seamlessly integrating sound effects following each line, with the added option to display images at the user's discretion.</li>
        <li>Developed the quest manager, responsible for monitoring and recording the player's in-game actions and progress within the game world.</li>

    <p><h2>Conquer Your Alcoholism</h2></p>
    <em>Unity 2D</em>
    <p>This game is designed to be a serious experience. The narrative unfolds as you emerge from rehabilitation, presented with a final opportunity at your current workplace. The objective is to survive while resisting the temptation of alcohol; losing all your money results in a game over.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lead Programer.</li>
        <li>Enhanced gameplay with vital features, including a robust health system, fluid movement mechanics, an engaging boss battle system, and a dynamic collectible system featuring valuable items such as currency and health pickups.</li>
        <li>Developed a dynamic system that simulates in-game intoxication by progressively blurring the player's screen with each hit. As the number of hits increases, the blurriness intensifies, accompanied by a gradual reduction in the player's movement speed. Upon reaching the maximum number of hits, the control scheme undergoes a switch, providing an immersive and challenging gaming experience.</li>
