    <p>Leonard Tatum</p>
    <em>In Fall 2020, I had the pleasure of mentoring and working with Angel . He is an amazing person
        and a delight to work with. He is also a really good engineer. There are a few characteristics that
        Angel has that makes it easy to work with him and the ideal candidate to hire. He is very
        respectful and kind. He treats everyone with admiration, and carries a welcoming aura that coworkers gravitate to. He is a very hard and reliable worker. The environment we worked in was
        Kanban and very fast paced. Generally, for beginning developers this sort of environment is
        tough to excel in. However, Angel made it his mission to voluntarily team up with co-workers
        and contribute wherever possible. He didn't mind if the tasks were more trivial, such as code
        documentation, technical diagrams, enforcing code stylization, formatting and best practices. Or
        more difficult tasks such as implementing full features. Whatever Angel did, he strived to do it
        right and was able to learn and adjust quickly along the way. I recommend Angel to any
        employer. He truly is a great engineer with a lot of potential. And I know he will add value to any
        software development team.
        </em>

    <p>Spenser Prelletz</p>
    <em>Angel was an incredible asset to our Dr. Seuss Experience team. He quickly proved himself in his role in turn was quickly promoted to lead his areas and team. Angel is always quick to the punch in bringing new ideas to the table, being the first to jump on a task or problem, and approaches every challenge with a calm, cool, collected and 'can-do' attitude. He's got great instincts and I know those attributes and more will allow him to be a great asset to any team that will have him. I would love to have him back on my team someday
        </em>

    <p>Ana Moreno</p>
    <em>Angel is a talented developer and professional. I had the pleasure of working with him while he was at SSEPSA. He is a great problem solver, thinks outside the box, and I would recommend him for projects. 
        </em>

    <p>Valerie Kolb</p>
    <em>I worked with Angel both as his senior and as his colleague. I have seen him seamlessly grow into a leadership position in a short timeframe while demonstrating impressive skills and professionalism. I highly recommend Angel to any team looking for a hardworking, dedicated member. I have no doubt that he will exceed your expectations and quickly become a key member of your team.
